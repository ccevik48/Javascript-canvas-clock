# Javascript-canvas-clock
Clock that displays local time; for the constructor, you provide position on the canvas (x and y position), the radius, the timezone (put zero for current time, and positive numbers for the number of time zones ahead, and negative for behind), and the font style in the form of a string with the px size followed by a space and font family.
